IRC applications were very famous during 90s where users could communicate in the form of a text. On this project a server side and a client side were developed with a simple GUI for the client side. After opening the server file, the users basically can connect to the port that the server runs and send their messages. Some features of this application are:


  - Send private messages
  - Make chat rooms
  - Use different commands from Client to Server or from Server to Client
